## L-UPWM code base

This repo contains the code associated with the light neural model. Additionally, in here we used an inhouse library for handling the training, which was added to _other_dependencies folder.

This code is manly offered as a way to visualize the step that we performed, however, anyone can run it with the additional care to change all of the hardcoded paths on the notebooks.

As informative note for runing the code it is first require the instalation of all of the depencies, which should be done by doing "./setup.sh", then the notebooks are ordered and should be executted by that order, so that every intermidite step is finished before starting the next one.
